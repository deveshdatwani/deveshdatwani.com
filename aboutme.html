        <p>
            I embarked on the journey of Robotics back in high school when I started building RC planes for a hobby. Reading about flight dynamics and electronics on the internet, I gathered enough knowledge to start building fixed wing RC aircraft. Nonetheless, it took me more than two prototypes to get a stable flight. Dramatic as it sounds, the process of building something and see it take flight gives me a high that cannot be matched with anything. The process of building, creating, innovating is my Ikegai.

            To fortify my hobby-turned-passion with formal training, I pursued undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, which helped me build a strong foundation in Robotics. My curriculum involved studies in subjects such as mechatronics, machine design, C programming, and industrial electronics.

            I am currently an incoming student of Ms in Robotics at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute, MA, United States of America.
