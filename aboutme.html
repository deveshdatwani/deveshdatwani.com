                Having been born into a family with three generations of engineers, curiosity was the natural mood of the home I grew up in. I embarked on the journey of robotics in high school when I started building RC planes to satiate my passion for aviation. 
                <br> <br>
                Reading about electronics and flight dynamics, I started building fixed-wing RC planes from scratch. The process of fabricating air-worthy aircraft frames and integrating it with necessary electronics to watch them take flight built my passion-filled foundation for a career in robotics engineering.

            <p>
                My robotics journey began right from high school when I started building fixed wing RC aircraft as a hobby to satiate my passion for aviation. To now fortify my hobby turned passion, I pursued an undergraduate program in mechanical engineering to develop knowledge in subjects of mechanics, aerodynamics, and programming. As part of my undergraduate course, I authored a thesis on plasma actuators for flow induction inside hollow pipes, the experiments of which were conducted at the Propulsion Lab at the Aerospace Department of IIT, Mumbai (Bombay). Having observed splendid results, my team and I decided to apply for a utility patent for the same. 
                <br><br>
                With exciting developments in the space of Deep Learning and limitations of innovation in mechanical engineering, the natural next step in my journey was to pursue a master's program that helps me develop the necessary skills to build autonomy for robots. This led me to pursue MS in Robotics Engineering at WPI (Worcester Polytechnic Institute). Shortly after joining, I was selected to represent WPI at the NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Extreme Challenge 2022 where my team and I built a robot that traverses Martian surface. My stint at WPI largely focuses on subject matters of robot perception. For this, I assisted in research at WPI robotics engineering labs like HiRo Human Inspired Robotics Lab, Popovic Labs and Surface Metrology Labs. My experience here involved developing fundamental foundation through hands on experience with classical computer vision algorithms, deep learning techniques and other sensors for object detection, image segmentation, pose estimation, homography estimation, SLAM and much more. Building a perception software stack for mobile robots is what drives my interest in this space.
                <br><br>
                Through this page, I would like to highlight one of the most recent and exciting projects I was a part of for my capstone experience at WPI. The project involved building a scalable mobile robot solution tailored to cater homeowners for maintaining real time fire safety preparedness and was designed and developed after extensive research and consultations with the Chief & Deputy Chief of the Worcester Fire Department, MA, USA. My team and I aimed solve a potential fire hazard situation with SLAM, computer vision and motion planning techniques in which I implemented a PCA & K Means algorithm to detect obstacles and map changes for homes by comparing maps generated with SLAM using LiDARS. The technique mentioned earlier was originally developed for applications in the remote sensing space. My team and I modified this to be implemented on point cloud data and achieved our objectives. The ingenuity of this idea has been the highlight of the project. This experience not only demonstrates my skills of critical thinking and innovation but also my ability to engage with stakeholders, identify problem statement and build a robotics solution as a product.
