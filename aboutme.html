                Having been born into a family with three generations of engineers, curiosity was the natural mood of the home I grew up in. I embarked on the journey of robotics in high school when I started building RC planes to satiate my passion for aviation. 
                <br> <br>
                Reading about electronics and flight dynamics, I started building fixed-wing RC planes from scratch. The process of fabricating air-worthy aircraft frames and integrating it with necessary electronics to watch them take flight built my passion-filled foundation for a career in robotics engineering.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                To fortify my hobby-turned-passion, I pursued undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering where I learnt subjects like mechatronics, machine design, production process, structured programming approach and industrial electronics.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I signed up for a Python Programming course right after my undergraduate studeis which I can say with conviction was a pivot point in defining my career path as it not only gave me the tool to start automating simple robots through a raspberry pi microcontroller, but also dive into machine learning and computer vision.   
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Robotics, Python and Machine Learning bridge the gap between my hobby and passion, which is to build autonomous vehicles.
