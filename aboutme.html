                With two generations of engineers, curiosity was the natural mood of the home I grew up in. I embarked on the journey of Robotics from high school when I started building RC planes to satiate my passion for aviation. Learning about electronics and flight dynamics on the internet, I started building fixed-wing RC planes from scratch. The process of building RC planes and watch them take flight built my passion-filled foundation for a career in engineering.

                To fortify my hobby-turned-passion, I pursued undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering. The curriculum of which involved subjects such as mechatronics, machine design, C programming, and industrial electronics.

                I signed up for a Python Programming course right after my undergraduate studeis which I can say with conviction was a pivot point in defining my career path. The idea of automating robots fills me up with excitement.

                Robotics, Python and Machine Learning bridge the gap between my hobby and passion, which is to build autonomous vehicles.
