                I embarked on the journey of Robotics back in high school when I started building RC planes as a hobby. Learning about flight dynamics and electronics on the internet, I started building fixed wing RC aircraft from scratch. The process of building RC planes and watch them take flight defined my passion. Innovating or just building stuff is my Ikegai.

                To fortify my hobby-turned-passion, I pursued undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, which helped me build a strong foundation in engineering. My curriculum involved subjects such as mechatronics, machine design, C programming, and industrial electronics.

                My career path took a detour when I joined my family-run business in ground logistics and air freighting 6 months after undergraduate studies. It was during this time that I realized the need for automation in logistics, from warehouse robotics to driver-less goods carriers. Such technology could revolutionize the ease of managing a logistics business. During the same time, I signed up for a Python Programming course nearby. I can say with conviction that taking this course played a pivotal role in defining my career path. I realized the immense power programming provides with to automate, especially Python.

                Python and Machine Learning bridge the gap between my hobby and passion which is to build autonomous vehicles.

                I quickly applied and started working for a digital marketing firm in Mumbai in which I worked with a team to build machine learning tools for remarketing projects. This was a formative experience as it gave me hands on experience with real world data which is essential to build an understanding of machine learning algorithms.
