        Why closetx? <br><br>
        Fashion and styling have always fascinated me. And greater appreciation towards design and styling came after reading Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson. I started seeing design thought flow in technology which I don't think I had an eye for before. <br> 
        <hr> 
        Switch to me moving to United States for my masters studies. And my appreciation for design and fashion was all over the place. Sure Boston, MA is not Paris or Rome, but it was still my first exposure to immaculate fashion sense.
        <br><br>
        Okay but why closetx? <br><br> 
        Think that you're a student, or just carry sentiments of rationality, thoughtful spending and frugality. 
        <br> 
        You buy clothes during sale, you look for used apparel on different services. 
        <br>
        You also scroll through online stores and look at the models styled up immaculalilty. You admire it, and once in a while, you "buy the look". But it always costs more than what you're happy to pay.
        <br><br>
        Sometimes, you buy clothes and don't wear them as often as you'd like, or return them, because it did not suit your style and there was no real way of assessing this before hand. 
        <hr> 
        This is where closetx comes in. Say-- <br><br>
        -- you have 3 trousers in your wardrobe <br>
        -- you have couple of t shirts <br>
        -- you're looking to shop outfits <br> 
        <br>        
        How do you pick a t shirt or a shirt that best suits your current wardrobe? Can the t shirt you buy be mixed and matched with other apparels in your wardrobe to create outfits? Can you buy one trouser and one t shirt that creates maybe 4 different looks by combining them with your exisiting wardrobe portfolio? <br><br>
        Closetx helps you do just that! <br><br>
        On the back-end of closetx, is a vision transformer. A machine learning model basically. It periodically learns fashion from human designers. It's basically you're AI fashion stylist. It is the friend you send pictures of apparels to, to ask if you should be buying them. <br> 
        Ps- on a different note-- do send that picture to your fashion guru friend. Human connection is good, it is essential for us social creatures.   
        <br>
        And that's how you can shop frugally, rationaly and effectively make the most out of the buck you put.
        <br><br>
        In a later post, I will write about how the model works, the architecture, the datasets, the training pipeline, schedules, the distributed system I am building to serve this application effectively etc etc.
        <br><br>
        Till then, thank you for reading. Ciao!
