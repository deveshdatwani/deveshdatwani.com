                <p>
                    Since the summer of 2011, I have been building aerial 
                    vehicles as a means to satiate my passion for aviation. 
                    Over the years, my projects have included fixed winged rc 
                    planes of varying configurations, quadcopters and more.

                <p>
                    I gained hands on experience while building them. While most 
                    of them were powered by brushless motors, some were powered by
                    nitro-methane powered IC engines. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will keep this page straighforward and put out snapshots of the 
                    aerial vehicles I built. Please note, these are only some of the drones/planes 
                    I built. Not all were documented.
